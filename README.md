# JLMMaterialPicker
JLM (standing for "Just like Max") little alternative tool to pick materials from the viewport 
just like 3ds max material picker and show the material network in the hypershade window

Basically it runs a Custom Maya context , 
in wich you pick a mesh without actually selecting it 
the scripts runs trough the shading network to find all related materials and focuses on them in your actual hypersahde working area

works better with hypersahde window already opened.

TODO : -Solve the refreshing problem that prevents the material picking right after the script opens the hypershade window for the first time   
       -create custom working area Tabs to
       -get to create a working area tab for each objects

this is an Experimental Script "use it at your own risk"
